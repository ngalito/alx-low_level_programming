Nested loops refer to the situation where one loop is placed inside another loop. This allows for more complex iteration and control flow in programming. Nested loops are commonly used to iterate over multi-dimensional data structures such as matrices or nested lists. 

Here's an example of nested loops in Python:

```python
for i in range(3):  # Outer loop
    for j in range(2):  # Inner loop
        print(f"({i}, {j})")
```

Output:
```
(0, 0)
(0, 1)
(1, 0)
(1, 1)
(2, 0)
(2, 1)
```

In the above example, there is an outer loop that iterates over the values 0, 1, and 2. Inside the outer loop, there is an inner loop that iterates over the values 0 and 1. The `print` statement within the inner loop will execute for each combination of the outer and inner loop variables, resulting in the output shown above.

Nested loops can be extended to more than two levels by adding additional inner loops inside the existing loops. However, it's important to be cautious with deeply nested loops as they can lead to performance issues, especially if the number of iterations is large.

Nested loops are a powerful construct for solving problems that require repeated iterations and nested data structures. They allow for exploring all possible combinations or permutations of values and performing operations based on those combinations.
