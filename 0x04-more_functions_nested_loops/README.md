Certainly! Here's an example of nested loops that demonstrate the concept of functions and nested loops:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void printPattern(int n) {
    int i, j;
    
    for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
            printf("* ");
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
}

int main() {
    int rows;

    printf("Enter the number of rows: ");
    scanf("%d", &rows);

    printPattern(rows);

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. The `printPattern` function takes an integer `n` as a parameter and prints a pattern of asterisks in a triangular shape.

2. The `main` function prompts the user to enter the number of rows for the pattern.

3. The user input is stored in the `rows` variable using `scanf`.

4. The `printPattern` function is called with `rows` as an argument.

5. Inside the `printPattern` function, there are two nested loops. The outer loop (with variable `i`) controls the number of rows, and the inner loop (with variable `j`) controls the number of asterisks printed in each row.

6. The inner loop iterates from 1 to `i` (the current row number), and for each iteration, it prints an asterisk followed by a space.

7. After the inner loop finishes, a newline character is printed to move to the next row.

8. The outer loop continues until it reaches `n`, which is the total number of rows specified by the user.

9. Once the pattern is printed, the program returns 0, indicating successful execution.

This program allows the user to input the number of rows they want in the pattern and then prints a triangular pattern of asterisks based on the input.
